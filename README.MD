# Motion Detector

This Project is built using Pythonâ€™s Cv2 library where the webcam of the user device captures video along with a Motion detector frame (green frame along with movement). 

It stores the motion details of the character in a .csv file and then outputs a graph showing the variations of motion in the whole timeframe.
